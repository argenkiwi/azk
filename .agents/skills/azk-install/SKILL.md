name: azk-install
description: Installs the `azk` CLI globally for the current user — a one-time, project-independent setup so any workspace can use `azk search/create/get/update/delete/link/reindex` as a bare command, backed by azk's own standalone repo (seven independent Ambler walks behind a single dispatcher). Also installs the on-demand `azk-reference` skill (CRUD JSON shapes and gotchas) into the current agent's own global skills directory. Use this whenever a user wants to install azk (or "the zettel/zettelkasten command") globally, system-wide, or for every project.

# Azk Install

Installs the `azk` binary globally (via `deno install --global`), wires up the *current agent's own* global configuration, and installs the on-demand `azk-reference` skill globally, so the Zettelkasten-RAG methodology is available in every workspace without any per-project setup. This skill never touches project files — a project that relies on this global install just gets `notes/` and `.azk/` created lazily on first use, wherever `azk` happens to be invoked.

---

## Step 1 — Locate the source repo

`azk` is a standalone repo (the one containing `deno.json` and `cli.ts`, with each subcommand implemented as its own independent walk under `walks/`):

- If this skill is being run from within an `azk` checkout, use the current directory.
- Otherwise, ask the user for the path to their local `azk` clone.

All commands below use `<repo>` for this path.

---

## Step 2 — Install the binary globally

```bash
deno install --global --force --allow-read --allow-write --allow-net --allow-env --env-file \
  --config "<repo>/deno.json" -n azk "<repo>/cli.ts"
```

`cli.ts` is a thin dispatcher: it argv-routes `azk <verb> ...` to the matching standalone walk under `walks/` (each of which is also independently runnable via `deno run walks/<verb>.ts` or `deno task <verb>`), so the installed binary still behaves as one unified command.

`--force` is required, not optional — this skill is meant to be re-run whenever the `azk` repo changes, and `deno install --global` refuses to overwrite an existing `azk` install without it (it'll fail with "Existing installation found" otherwise).

Confirm the Deno installation bin directory (typically `~/.deno/bin` on macOS/Linux) is on the shell's `PATH`. If `azk` isn't found after installing, that's almost always why — tell the user to add it to their shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bashrc`, etc.) and re-open their shell.

---

## Step 3 — Merge the global Zettelkasten protocol

Read this skill's `assets/AGENTS.md` — the bare-`azk`-command variant of the "Zettelkasten RAG Protocol".

Merge it into **your own** global instructions file — whichever one you already know applies to every project you work in (e.g. `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `~/.gemini/config/AGENTS.md` for Gemini CLI). Don't guess a path for a different agent; use the one you actually read your own global instructions from.

- If that file doesn't contain a "Zettelkasten RAG Protocol" section yet, append the asset's content to the end, separated by a blank line — never overwrite existing instructions.
- If a "# Zettelkasten RAG Protocol" section is already present (e.g. from a previous install), replace just that section instead of duplicating it — match on the heading text, not the exact heading level, since some global instruction files may nest it under a parent section.

---

## Step 4 — Install the azk-reference skill globally

Copy the sibling `azk-reference` skill directory into **your own** global skills directory — whichever one you already know applies to every project you work in (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/` for Claude Code). Don't guess a path for a different agent; use the one you actually load your own skills from.

```bash
cp -R "<repo>/.agents/skills/azk-reference" "<your global skills dir>/azk-reference"
```

If a stale `zettel` skill directory already exists in that same global skills directory (e.g. `~/.claude/skills/zettel/`), delete it — it's a pre-rebrand leftover documenting a `zettel` command and `.zettelkasten/zettel.db` path that no longer exist (everything was renamed to `azk`/`.azk/azk.db`), and it's now fully superseded by `azk-reference`.

---

## Step 5 — Verify

From a directory *outside* this repo, confirm the global install actually resolves and runs standalone. Use whatever scratch/temp directory is appropriate for the current agent's environment (e.g. a dedicated scratchpad directory if one applies) rather than defaulting to `/tmp`:

```bash
cd "<scratch-dir>" && azk reindex && azk search "test" && \
  echo '{"title":"smoke test","body":"verifying the global azk install"}' | azk create
```

`reindex`/`search` alone only create `.azk/` — `notes/` is created lazily by `utils/fs.ts` the first time a note is actually written, so the `create` call above is what proves "no per-project init needed" in practice. Confirm all three commands run without error and that both `notes/` and `.azk/` now exist in that directory with no pre-existing scaffolding.

---

## Step 6 — Report success

```
Installed azk globally:
  binary          — `azk`, on PATH via deno install --global
  global config   — Zettelkasten RAG Protocol merged into <path to the agent's own global instructions file>
  global skill    — azk-reference installed into <your global skills dir>/azk-reference (CRUD JSON shapes, gotchas)

Any workspace can now use `azk search`/`azk create`/`azk get`/`azk update`/`azk delete`/`azk link`/`azk reindex` directly — `notes/` and `.azk/` are created lazily on first use.
```

## Checklist before finishing

- [ ] `azk` resolves on `PATH` and runs from a directory outside `<repo>`.
- [ ] The agent's own global instructions file contains exactly one "Zettelkasten RAG Protocol" section, using the bare `azk <cmd>` form.
- [ ] `azk-reference` exists in the agent's own global skills directory.
- [ ] Any stale `zettel` skill directory in that same location has been removed.
- [ ] No files were created or modified inside any project directory — this skill only touches the global binary install, the agent's global config, and the agent's global skills directory.
