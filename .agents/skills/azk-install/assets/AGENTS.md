# Zettelkasten RAG Protocol

This workspace has a Zettelkasten — an atomic, explicitly-linked note store. Notes are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter under `notes/` (the version-controlled source of truth, editable in Obsidian/HelixNotes or by hand); `.azk/azk.db` is a derived, gitignored SQLite index (full-text search, optional semantic embeddings, and the link graph) rebuildable from `notes/` at any time. It exists so design decisions and gotchas compound across sessions instead of being re-discovered every time. Use it via the global `azk` command below; do not read or write `.azk/azk.db` directly. If you ever hand-edit a file under `notes/`, run `azk reindex` afterward so the index reflects it.

**Before implementing any non-trivial prompt:**

```bash
azk search "<short summary of the task>"
```

Read the returned notes before writing code. If a note is directly relevant, treat it as prior art — don't rediscover a decision that's already been made (or, if you disagree with it, say so and update it).

**After completing the work:**

```bash
echo '{"title":"<short title>","body":"<what you decided or learned, and why>","tags":["<tag>"],"links":[{"toId":"<id>","relation":"<short phrase>"}]}' | azk create
```

Capture the *non-obvious* part — a decision, a constraint, a gotcha — not a restatement of the diff. One idea per note. If it builds on or contradicts a note found during search, include it in `links` with a short relation phrase (e.g. "builds on", "supersedes").

**When existing guidance turns out stale or wrong:**

```bash
echo '{"title":"..."}' | azk update <id>   # partial {title?,body?,tags?} via stdin
azk delete <id>
```

Prefer updating over leaving a contradicting note next to the old one.

**To connect two existing notes explicitly** (the deliberate-linking step, independent of creation-time links):

```bash
azk link <fromId> <toId> "<relation phrase>"
```

**To fetch one note and its links:**

```bash
azk get <id>
```

**After a fresh clone, or if the index ever drifts from the Markdown files:**

```bash
azk reindex
```

The index is gitignored, so a fresh checkout starts with none — run this once before the first `search`. It's always safe to delete `.azk/` and rebuild it this way.

All seven subcommands print a single JSON object/array to stdout — parse it directly. Search blends keyword (FTS5) and, when a local OpenAI-compatible embeddings host is reachable (default `http://localhost:11434/v1`, model `embeddinggemma:latest` — override either via the `EMBEDDING_HOST`/`EMBEDDING_MODEL` env vars, e.g. in a `.env` file), semantic similarity — it degrades gracefully to keyword-only if no such host is running.

For the exact JSON shape of each subcommand's output and edge-case gotchas (stdin must be valid JSON, partial-update semantics, delete cascades to links), invoke the `azk-reference` skill.
